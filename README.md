# APM_Final_Project
Code for my group's final project for our Advanced Predictive Modeling class. 

Our project was centered around predicting pass outcomes in the NFL. Is still a work in progress, as we are delving into predictive motion analytics.

All of the initial raw data can be found through this Kaggle competition.
